This Bank Analysis Project aims to derive actionable insights from loan data to enhance decision-making, risk management, and customer service. Analyzed year-wise loan amounts, grade and sub-grade revolving balances, and
compare total payments for verified versus non-verified loans. Additionally, examined state-wise and month-wise loan statuses and the correlation between homeownership and payment behaviors. The project's goal is to
provide the bank with deeper customer insights, improved risk assessment, and optimized operations for better strategic decisions.
